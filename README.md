## üéØ Overview

Shopping Cart enables two distinct workflows for item requests:

### Workflow A: Requester Has Items
1. Player has items and needs them delivered
2. Creates request with pickup/delivery locations and reward
3. Fulfiller claims the request
4. Requester creates courier contract to fulfiller
5. System tracks contract via ESI and auto-completes

### Workflow B: Fulfiller Buys Items
1. Player needs items purchased and delivered
2. Creates request with shopping list and maximum budget
3. Fulfiller buys items from market
4. Fulfiller creates contract to requester
5. System tracks acceptance and completion

## üîê Permissions

Shopping Cart uses a four-tier permission system:

| Permission | Codename | Description | Recommended For |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Basic Access** | `basic_access` | View app and browse marketplace | All members |
| **Request Items** | `request_items` | Create and manage item requests | Members who need items |
| **Fulfill Requests** | `fulfill_requests` | Claim and fulfill orders | Trusted haulers/traders |
| **Manage Requests** | `manage_requests` | Full admin access to all requests | Leadership/Admins |

### Assigning Permissions

#### Via Django Admin:

1. Navigate to **Django Admin** (usually `/admin/`)
2. Go to **Authentication and Authorization** ‚Üí **Groups**
3. Select or create a group (e.g., "Members", "Logistics")
4. Find permissions under `shopping_cart | general`
5. Add desired permissions to the group
6. Assign users to the group

#### Via Alliance Auth States:

1. Navigate to **Django Admin** ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **States**
2. Edit a state (e.g., "Member" state)
3. Add Shopping Cart permissions to the state
4. All users in that state automatically get permissions

### Permission Inheritance

- **Superusers** automatically have all permissions
- Permissions are cumulative (higher permissions include lower ones)
- Users without `basic_access` cannot see the app in navigation

---

## üîë ESI Setup

For automatic contract tracking, users must authorize ESI tokens.

### Required Scope

- `esi-contracts.read_character_contracts.v1`

This allows the app to:
- Read contract information
- Monitor contract status
- Detect acceptance and completion
- Auto-update request status

### Adding ESI Token (For Users)

1. **Navigate to ESI Token Management**
   - Alliance Auth Dashboard
   - Click **Services** ‚Üí **Add ESI Token**

2. **Select Character**
   - Choose the character you'll use for contracts
   - This is usually your main trading/hauling character

3. **Authorize Scopes**
   - EVE SSO login page appears
   - Check that `esi-contracts.read_character_contracts.v1` is listed
   - Click **Authorize**

4. **Verify Token**
   - Token appears in your token list
   - Status should show "Valid"
   - Expiration date displayed

### Token Usage

- **Requesters:** Need token if creating contracts (Workflow A)
- **Fulfillers:** Need token if creating contracts (Workflow B)
- **Monitoring:** System uses tokens to track contract status
- **Privacy:** Only contract info is read, no other data accessed

### Troubleshooting ESI

**Token Not Working:**
- Verify scope is correct
- Check token is not expired
- Refresh token in Alliance Auth
- Re-authorize if needed

**Contract Not Tracked:**
- Ensure ESI monitoring character is set
- Verify contract is created by correct character
- Check Celery workers are running
- Wait for next monitoring cycle (max 10 minutes)

## üîî Discord Integration

Enable real-time notifications to keep your alliance informed.

### Setup Discord Webhook

#### 1. Create Webhook in Discord

1. Open Discord and navigate to your server
2. Go to **Server Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations**
3. Click **Webhooks** ‚Üí **New Webhook**
4. Configure webhook:
   - **Name:** "Shopping Cart Bot"
   - **Channel:** Choose notification channel (e.g., #logistics)
   - **Avatar:** Optional custom icon
5. Click **Copy Webhook URL**

#### 2. Configure in Alliance Auth

Add to your `local.py`:

```python
SHOPPING_CART_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789/abcdefghijklmnop"
```

#### 3. Customize Notifications

```python
# Enable/disable specific notification types
SHOPPING_CART_NOTIFY_ON_NEW_REQUEST = True   # New request created
SHOPPING_CART_NOTIFY_ON_CLAIM = True         # Request claimed
SHOPPING_CART_NOTIFY_ON_COMPLETION = True    # Request completed
SHOPPING_CART_NOTIFY_ON_CANCELLATION = False # Request cancelled
```

### Notification Examples

**New Request Created:**
```
üõí New Request #42
User: JohnDoe created a new request
Type: Requester Has Items | Items: 5 items
Route: Jita IV ‚Üí Amarr VIII
```

**Request Claimed:**
```
‚úã Request #42 Claimed
Fulfiller: JaneDoe claimed the request
Original Requester: JohnDoe
```

**Request Completed:**
```
‚úÖ Request #42 Completed!
Contract has been completed
Requester: JohnDoe | Fulfiller: JaneDoe
```

### Webhook Security

- Keep webhook URL private
- Regenerate if compromised (Discord server settings)
- URL contains authentication token
- Do not commit URL to public repositories

## ‚öôÔ∏è Celery Tasks

Shopping Cart includes background tasks for automation.

### Periodic Tasks

| Task | Schedule | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `shopping_cart_monitor_active_contracts` | Every 10 minutes | Check contract status via ESI |
| `shopping_cart_cleanup_old_requests` | Daily at 3:00 AM UTC | Remove old completed/cancelled requests |
| `shopping_cart_expire_abandoned_requests` | Daily at 4:00 AM UTC | Mark old pending requests as expired |

### Configuration

Tasks are configured in `local.py` as shown in [Step 5 of Installation](#step-5-configure-celery-tasks-required).

### Manual Task Execution

You can manually trigger tasks from Django shell:

```python
from shopping_cart.tasks import monitor_contract_status, cleanup_old_requests

# Monitor specific request
monitor_contract_status.delay(request_id=42)

# Run cleanup now
cleanup_old_requests.delay()
```

### Verify Celery is Running

```bash
# Check Celery worker status
supervisorctl status myauth-worker

# Check Celery beat status (scheduler)
supervisorctl status myauth-beat

# View Celery logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/myauth-worker.log
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/myauth-beat.log
```

### Task Logs

You should see entries like:
```
[INFO] Scheduler: Sending due task shopping_cart_monitor_active_contracts
[INFO] Task shopping_cart.tasks.monitor_all_active_contracts[abc-123] succeeded
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Installation Package Not Found Error

**Issue:** `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement shopping_cart==0.1.0`

**Cause:** Mismatch between package name and app name in configuration.

**Solution:**
- **For GitHub installation:** Use `allianceauth-shopping-cart==0.1.0` in requirements.txt
- **App name in INSTALLED_APPS:** Always use `'shopping_cart'` (the Python module name)
- **Package name for pip:** Use `allianceauth-shopping-cart` (from pyproject.toml)

```bash
# In requirements.txt (for Alliance Auth)
allianceauth-shopping-cart==0.1.0

# In local.py INSTALLED_APPS
INSTALLED_APPS += [
    'shopping_cart',  # Python module name, not package name
]
```

### App Not Showing in Menu

**Possible Causes:**
- User doesn't have `basic_access` permission
- App not in `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Services not restarted after installation

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify settings
python manage.py diffsettings | grep shopping_cart

# Check permissions
python manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.get(username='yourname')
>>> user.has_perm('shopping_cart.basic_access')

# Restart services
supervisorctl restart myauth:
```

### Cannot Create Requests

**Possible Causes:**
- Missing `request_items` permission
- No main character set
- Form validation errors

**Solutions:**
- Assign `request_items` permission
- Set main character in profile
- Check for JavaScript errors (F12 developer console)

### Contract Tracking Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
- Missing ESI token
- Wrong scope on token
- Celery not running
- Monitoring character not set

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Celery is running
supervisorctl status myauth-worker
supervisorctl status myauth-beat

# Verify ESI token
python manage.py shell
>>> from esi.models import Token
>>> Token.objects.filter(character_id=YOUR_CHAR_ID).require_scopes(['esi-contracts.read_character_contracts.v1']).require_valid().first()

# Manually trigger monitoring
>>> from shopping_cart.tasks import monitor_contract_status
>>> monitor_contract_status.delay(request_id=42)
```

### Celery Tasks Not Running

**Possible Causes:**
- Celery beat not running
- Tasks not added to `CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE`
- Syntax error in `local.py`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Celery beat status
supervisorctl status myauth-beat

# Restart Celery beat
supervisorctl restart myauth-beat

# Check logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/myauth-beat.log

# Verify configuration
python manage.py shell
>>> from django.conf import settings
>>> 'shopping_cart_monitor_active_contracts' in settings.CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE
True
```

### Database Migration Errors

**Issue:** Migration fails with foreign key error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure eveonline app is migrated first
python manage.py migrate eveonline

# Then migrate shopping_cart
python manage.py migrate shopping_cart
```

### Static Files Not Loading

**Issue:** CSS/JS not working, pages look broken

**Solution:**
```bash
# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Verify STATIC_ROOT setting
python manage.py findstatic shopping_cart/css/shopping_cart.css

# Check web server (nginx/apache) static file serving
```

### Discord Notifications Not Sending

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid webhook URL
- Webhook deleted in Discord
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Test webhook manually
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Test message"}'

# Check logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/allianceauth/allianceauth.log | grep shopping_cart
```

### Performance Issues

**Issue:** Slow page loads or timeouts

**Solutions:**
- Enable database query caching
- Increase gunicorn workers
- Optimize PostgreSQL settings
- Check Celery queue backlog

```bash
# Check Celery queue length
python manage.py shell
>>> from celery import current_app
>>> current_app.control.inspect().active_queues()
```
